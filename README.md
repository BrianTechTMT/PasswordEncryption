Password Encryption Project
This project demonstrates a simple way to generate a secure password, encrypt it using a master password, and later decrypt it. It uses Python and the cryptography library to perform encryption and decryption.

Features
Secure Password Generation:
Generates a random password with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

Encryption:
Encrypts the generated password using a key derived from a user-supplied master password and a randomly generated salt. The salt and encrypted password are stored in a text file.

Decryption:
Reads the encrypted file and decrypts the password using the master password.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

cryptography Library:
Install the cryptography package using pip:

bash
Copy
python -m pip install cryptography
If pip is not recognized, ensure Python and pip are added to your system's PATH.

Files
EncryptPass.py
This script generates a secure password, encrypts it using a master password, and saves the salt and encrypted data to a file (encrypted_password.txt).

DecryptPass.py
This script reads the encrypted file, asks for the master password, and decrypts the password, displaying the original password.

Usage
Encrypting a Password
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the encryption script:
bash
Copy
python EncryptPass.py
When prompted, enter your master password for encryption.
The script will display the generated password and save the encrypted data to encrypted_password.txt.
Decrypting the Password
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the decryption script:
bash
Copy
python DecryptPass.py
Enter the master password when prompted.
The script will display the decrypted password.
How It Works
Password Generation:
A secure random password is generated that includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one symbol.

Key Derivation:
A key is derived from the master password using PBKDF2HMAC with a randomly generated salt.

Encryption:
The generated password is encrypted using the derived key and the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme.

Decryption:
The decryption script reads the salt and encrypted password from the file, derives the same key using the provided master password, and decrypts the password.
